	// bug: even a hand-parsed `if (true) {...}` hit it, nothing to do with switch specifically);
	// (2) the discriminant's own wrapper node was built by hand but never threaded into the state
	// chain via `rebindVar`, so `let __disc = ...;` never printed even though every case read it;
	// (3) an initial `while (true) { ...; break; }` wrapping (chosen for break's syntactic
	// validity) was itself a real loop, so a `continue` inside a case -- which real JS routes PAST
	// a switch to the nearest enclosing loop -- got wrongly caught by the wrapper instead, an
	// infinite loop whenever the switch's own discriminant stayed constant. Fixed by giving switch
	// its own minimal `break_scope` graph anchor (no mu/theta, no continue target of its own),
