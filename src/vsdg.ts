// ===================================================================
//  The language-neutral VSDG middle end.
// ===================================================================
// BuildVSDG -> Optimize -> applyGlobalCodeMotion -> BuildProgram, over ANY of the three
// converged ASTs (ts/js-parser, py/py-parser, cpp/cpp-parser). Everything in this file is
// either pure graph machinery (nodes, edges, scopes, mu/theta/gamma, GCM, CSE, folding) or a
// question asked of a `Dialect`.
//
// A language supplies three things, one job each -- the first and last are interfaces this file names,
// the middle one it never does: how an AST is walked is that language's own business, and the core
// only ever sees the `Recurse` it is handed.
//
//   * `Dialect`	 -- FACTS about the language that the core asks about (how to spell a name,
//					  what a literal is, which operators fold, what is unsafe to CSE). Stateless
//					  and reachable from the graph (`graph.dialect`), because the optimiser and the
//					  emitter hold only a graph;
//   * LOWERING	 -- this language's own `walkerB` (how its AST nests) plus one callback per
//					  statement/expression tag, wired up and driven by that language alone
//					  (`TSBuilder.walkerB()` + its own `BuildVSDG`). NO INTERFACE: the core never walks an
//					  AST, so it never names any of it -- see `Recurse` for the one part it does name. The
//					  callbacks are methods on that language's `VSDGBuilder` subclass, whose base supplies
//					  the run's state and the primitives they write against (makeNode/connectEnd/
//					  rebindVar/bindVar/buildLoop/walkBranch/mergeState/reconcileVariables/buildFunctionBody/
//					  lowerVerbatim). They DRIVE those primitives in an order they choose, which is why
//					  they can't be abstract members the way `Emitter`'s are -- and why the walker stays
//					  the language's own object: the primitives that must reach it lazily
//					  (buildLoop/buildFunctionBody/buildClass) take it as a parameter, so a builder is
//					  built from nothing but a `Dialect` and never points back at the walker driving it;
//   * `Emitter`	 -- RECONSTRUCTION: graph nodes back onto this language's AST, plus that AST's
//					  statement constructors. Each language already has a printer for its own AST,
//					  so an emitter only ever rebuilds nodes, never source text.
//
// What it does NOT supply: any knowledge of `floating`/`mutation`/`effect`/`member` payload
// shapes. Instead, the language STAMPS the few shape facts the core genuinely needs onto the node
// when it creates it -- `plainAssign` (a mutation whose port 0 is the never-read old value),
// `freshTarget` (an lvalue address that must always rebuild). That is the same idiom as the
// pre-existing `switchInternal`/`scopeAnchorId`/`capturedRead` stamps, and it is what keeps
// `RawNode`'s own methods language-free. Whether an expression is a CONSTANT is deliberately NOT one
// of them: that is a fact about this language's own literal forms, so the dialect answers it.
//
// Generics: E = expression, S = statement, T = type annotation. `B` (a fourth parameter every node
// and scope still carries) is now unused -- see ParamSlot for where its destructuring job went.
