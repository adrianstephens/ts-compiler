//	Promise (async/await)
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// A Promise<T> with real microtask ordering but no host-driven asynchrony at all (no timer/fetch/IO
// imports anywhere), so "pending" only ever means "waiting on some other compiled code to call
// resolve()", never real external I/O. Rejection/'.catch' isn't modeled (no try/catch exists yet
// either, a separate pre-existing gap) -- a Promise that's never resolved just never fires its
// callbacks.
// 'resolve' is a real public method instead of an executor-only callback, which is all
// `async`/`await` codegen itself needs (it always resolves its own result Promise directly, never
// through a captured closure). The standard 'new Promise((resolve, reject) => ...)' executor form
// isn't modeled -- a real, separate gap (see backend.ts's own top-of-file comment). The constructor's
// own `initial` param exists only because every field needs a real assignment somewhere in the
// constructor and there's no generic "default T" expressible in source for an unconstrained type
// param -- `value` is overwritten for real the moment `resolve()` runs (guarded by `settled`
// everywhere it's read), so `initial`'s own value never actually matters.

// WASI gives this runtime no event loop of its own, so the microtask queue is plain module-level
// state: a callback is NEVER invoked inline by 'then'/'resolve' (real JS never does either, even when
// the promise is already settled), only pushed here. Nothing auto-drains it -- there's no task
// boundary in a single synchronous WASI entry call -- so a real program that needs queued callbacks
// to actually run must call 'drainMicrotasks()' itself, same as 'resolve()' already has to be called
// explicitly to make any progress at all.
const microtasks: (() => void)[] = [];

// The host's own call into an export IS the job boundary -- exactly what a libuv callback is for node
// -- so the queue drains when the OUTERMOST exported call returns, never in the middle of one. The
// depth counter is what makes "outermost" real: node performs its microtask checkpoint at callback
// depth 0 for the same reason, so a re-entrant call (host -> export -> host callback -> export) does
// not run continuations early. towasm emits the two hooks around every export, but only in a program
// that actually reached this queue -- see its `microtasks` lazy-global check.
